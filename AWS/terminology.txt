Networking:


	Route 53 - DNS service of AWS

	1. Create VPC then create IGW(internet gateway) then attache them;
	2. Create route 0.0.0.0/0 attached it to IGW;
	3. Create ACLs connect to VPC add rules (Outbound/inbound) Allow HTTP to all(0.0.0.0/0);
	4. Create Subnet and asssociate them with ACLs;
