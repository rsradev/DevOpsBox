Hash Functions
Mathematical algorithms
Generate a fixed-length result
Always the same from a given input
Summary of the original data
One-way algorithm
Example
Hello Mr. Born! - 7f2a0177f4d55500563881000e9b18af
hello Mr. Born! - ff38c3c9dcf2891a19e8164843a408e3
Hello Mr. Born - 897cacdc19b5bb20898f926ad8dbc05b
Hello Mr. Born, - 4b42f584469d23d01d45e1dcf49837e3
Introduction:

Hash functions are critical tools in the world of computer science and cybersecurity. They are mathematical algorithms designed to generate a unique, fixed-length value for any given input, acting as a kind of "summary" of the original data. Let’s dive into how they work and why they are so important.

Key Points to Cover:

What is a Hash Function?

A hash function takes input data of any length and transforms it into a fixed-length output, often called a hash value or digest.
The process is deterministic—meaning that for the same input, the hash value will always be the same.
Unique Output for Similar Inputs:

Notice in the examples on the slide how even small changes in the input, like capitalizing a letter or adding punctuation, produce entirely different hash values. This is intentional and makes hash functions highly sensitive to changes.
One-Way Algorithm:

Hash functions are designed to be one-way, meaning you cannot reverse the hash value to get the original input. This property is essential for security use cases like storing passwords.
Use Cases:

Hash functions are widely used in digital signatures, data integrity checks, password storage, and blockchain technology.
For instance, in blockchain, hash functions ensure the integrity of transactions, and in password storage, hashes protect user credentials.
Real-World Examples:

MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are common hash functions, though MD5 and SHA-1 are now considered insecure for sensitive applications due to vulnerabilities.
Examples:

Let’s review the examples provided:
The string Hello Mr. Born! produces a specific hash value.
Even minor changes, like changing Born! to Born, or altering capitalization, result in entirely different hash values.
This property is what makes hash functions ideal for ensuring data integrity—if the hash value changes, it’s clear the original data has been modified.
Demonstration (Optional):

If time permits, we could demonstrate hashing live using a tool like an online hash calculator or a Python script with the hashlib library.
Conclusion:

Hash functions are foundational to many security mechanisms because they create unique, fixed-length digests that are highly sensitive to input changes and cannot be reversed. They are indispensable tools for data integrity, authentication, and security in modern computing.

Mutation Testing
A technique that evaluates the quality of unit tests
Introduce small code changes (mutations) and checking if the tests fail
Ensures tests are robust and cover edge cases
Introduction:

Mutation testing is an advanced testing technique that deliberately introduces bugs (mutations) into the code to check whether the existing test cases can detect them. If tests don’t catch the mutation, it suggests gaps in test coverage.
How It Works:

Mutations are introduced into the code (e.g., changing + to -, flipping boolean conditions).
Tests are run against the mutated code.
If tests fail, the mutation is detected (good).
If tests pass, the mutation survives, indicating a potential gap in the test suite.
