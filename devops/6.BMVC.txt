Introduction
Let’s start by understanding the concept of Bare Metal in computing. This term refers to an environment where the operating system and applications are installed directly onto physical servers, without any virtualization layer in between.

Definition
In a Bare Metal setup, there is no hypervisor or containerization layer. Applications and the operating system run directly on the server’s physical hardware. This setup is often used for workloads that require maximum performance or access to specialized hardware.

Advantages
High Performance:

Because there’s no virtualization layer, applications have direct access to the hardware, which eliminates the overhead associated with virtual machines or containers. This results in better performance.
Increased Security:

Bare metal environments have fewer layers, reducing potential attack vectors. With fewer components, there are fewer opportunities for vulnerabilities to be exploited.
Customizability:

With bare metal, you have full control over both the hardware and software configurations, allowing for specific optimizations that might not be possible in virtualized environments.
Flexibility:

Bare metal provides full access to hardware devices, which is critical for workloads that rely on specialized hardware, such as GPUs or high-performance storage devices.

Disadvantages

Virtualization Types
Hardware Virtualization
Container (OS-Level) Virtualization
Application Virtualization
Presentation Virtualization
More…
Note: These days, the term 'virtualization' is everywhere, but it’s often just a marketing buzzword!

Introduction
Let’s explore the different types of virtualization, which serve various purposes in modern IT environments. Virtualization has evolved into a broad term, encompassing techniques that simulate hardware, applications, or even user interfaces.

Virtualization Types
Hardware Virtualization:

This is the most commonly known type of virtualization, where physical hardware is abstracted into multiple virtual machines (VMs).
Hypervisors like VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM enable multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server, sharing resources while maintaining isolation.
Container Virtualization:

Unlike traditional hardware virtualization, container virtualization uses shared operating system resources to run applications in isolated environments.
Containers, powered by tools like Docker or Kubernetes, are lightweight and provide efficient resource utilization.
Application Virtualization:

This type of virtualization isolates an application from the underlying operating system, allowing it to run in a virtual environment.
It’s useful for avoiding compatibility issues or conflicts, as seen with tools like Citrix XenApp or VMware ThinApp.
Presentation Virtualization:

Also known as remote desktop virtualization, this allows users to interact with applications or desktops hosted on a remote server.
Technologies like Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and Citrix Virtual Apps provide this capability, often used in enterprise settings.
More…:

Virtualization has expanded into other areas, including storage virtualization (abstracting storage resources into a unified pool) and network virtualization (creating virtual network devices and connections).
These approaches are foundational to modern cloud infrastructure.

Important Note
These days, the term ‘virtualization’ is everywhere, but it’s often used as a marketing buzzword.
It’s important to understand what’s truly being virtualized and how it provides value, rather than accepting the term at face value.

Conclusion
In summary, virtualization comes in many forms—hardware, containers, applications, and more—each tailored to specific use cases. By understanding the different types, we can better choose the right virtualization approach for our workloads.

Hypervisor

The software that creates and manages the virtual machines
We also use the terms

Guest OS
Host OS
Introduction
Let’s dive deeper into Hardware Virtualization, one of the most fundamental types of virtualization. It allows a single physical machine to run multiple virtual machines (VMs), each acting like a separate computer.

Virtual Machine (VM)
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a virtualized environment that behaves like a physical computer. Each VM can have its own:
Operating System: This could be Windows, Linux, or any other OS, independent of the physical machine’s OS.
Applications: You can install and run applications inside the VM just as you would on a physical computer.

Hypervisor
At the heart of hardware virtualization is the hypervisor, the software that creates, manages, and runs virtual machines.
The hypervisor’s job is to abstract the physical hardware and allocate resources like CPU, memory, and storage to the VMs.
Popular hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM.

Key Terms
Guest OS: This is the operating system running inside the virtual machine.
Host OS: This is the operating system running on the physical machine, which hosts the hypervisor and manages the VMs.

Example Workflow
To put it all together:
The physical server (host machine) runs the host OS.
The hypervisor is installed on the host OS and creates multiple VMs.
Each VM runs its own guest OS and applications independently.

Conclusion
In summary, hardware virtualization enables us to efficiently use physical resources by creating virtual machines. The hypervisor is the key component that makes this possible, allowing multiple VMs, each with their own guest OS, to coexist on a single host machine.

Full Virtualization
Guest OS is unaware that it is virtualized
Guest OS does not require any modifications
Virtual Machine has all standard components
Virtual processors
Memory
Network Adapters
Virtual Disks
Introduction
Let’s discuss Full Virtualization, a type of hardware virtualization where the guest operating system (OS) operates as if it were running on a physical machine, without any awareness of being virtualized.

Guest OS is Unaware
Full Virtualization ensures that the guest OS is completely unaware that it is running in a virtualized environment.
The hypervisor creates a virtual hardware layer that perfectly mimics a physical machine, so the guest OS doesn’t require any special modifications or adjustments to function.

No Modifications Required
Unlike other virtualization approaches, full virtualization does not require modifications to the guest OS. This makes it compatible with any operating system, as long as the hypervisor supports it.
For example, you can run unmodified versions of Windows or Linux as guest OSes on a fully virtualized environment.

Virtual Machine Components
In a fully virtualized setup, the virtual machine includes all the standard hardware components of a physical machine, such as:
Virtual Processors: These emulate the physical CPU, allowing the guest OS to perform computations.
Memory: Virtual memory is allocated from the host machine’s physical memory and dedicated to the VM.
Network Adapters: Virtual network interfaces allow the VM to connect to the network, just like a physical machine.
Virtual Disks: These are virtualized storage devices, typically stored as files on the host machine, but they appear as physical drives to the guest OS.

Conclusion
In summary, Full Virtualization provides a seamless experience for the guest OS by mimicking physical hardware completely. This compatibility and flexibility make it a widely used approach in enterprise virtualization, enabling the use of unmodified operating systems and applications within virtual machines.

Para virtualization
Guest OS is modified
Guest OS is aware that it is running on a hypervisor
Guest OS does not communicate directly with the hardware
Guest OS communicates with the hypervisior
All privileged instructions are replaced with direct calls to the hypervisior
Introduction
Let’s explore Para-Virtualization, a different approach to virtualization where the guest operating system (OS) is modified to work in cooperation with the hypervisor for improved performance.

Modified Guest OS
In para-virtualization, the guest OS is specifically modified to be aware that it is running in a virtualized environment.
This awareness allows the guest OS to interact more efficiently with the hypervisor, bypassing some of the overhead seen in emulated full virtualization.

Guest OS Communicates with the Hypervisor
Unlike full virtualization, where the guest OS communicates with virtual hardware, in para-virtualization:
The guest OS does not communicate directly with the hardware.
The guest OS communicates with the hypervisor directly, using specialized instructions called hypercalls.
These hypercalls enable the guest OS to perform privileged operations, like accessing hardware or managing resources, by working with the hypervisor.

Privileged Instructions
One key characteristic of para-virtualization is that all privileged instructions, which normally require direct hardware access, are replaced with direct calls to the hypervisor.
This approach reduces the performance overhead because the hypervisor doesn’t need to emulate hardware for privileged operations.

Advantages of Para-Virtualization
By working directly with the hypervisor, para-virtualization can offer better performance compared to emulated full virtualization because it eliminates some of the complexity.
However, it requires modifications to the guest OS, which can limit its compatibility with certain operating systems.

Conclusion
In summary, para-virtualization is a highly efficient approach where the guest OS is modified to communicate directly with the hypervisor. This cooperation reduces overhead but comes with the trade-off of requiring guest OS modifications, making it less universal than full virtualization.

Hardware assisted virtualization
Approach that enables efficient full virtualization
Uses the capabilities of the hardware

Introduction
Let’s discuss Hardware-Assisted Virtualization, an approach that significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of full virtualization by leveraging capabilities built directly into the hardware and avoid emulation.

Definition
Hardware-Assisted Virtualization is a technology that allows the hardware to assist the hypervisor in creating and managing virtual machines.
This approach eliminates much of the performance overhead of software-only emulated full virtualization, making it both faster and more efficient.

Key Characteristics
Efficient Full Virtualization:

Hardware-assisted virtualization provides native support for full virtualization, enabling the guest OS to run unmodified while maintaining performance comparable to running directly on hardware.
Hardware Support:

Modern processors from Intel (using Intel VT-x) and AMD (using AMD-V) include extensions specifically designed for virtualization.
These extensions allow the hypervisor to offload certain tasks to the hardware, reducing complexity and improving performance.

The Ring -1 Concept (Refer to Diagram)
In computing, the ring model represents different privilege levels for executing code, from Ring 0 (most privileged, where the OS kernel runs) to Ring 3 (least privileged, where user applications run).
In software-based full virtualization, the hypervisor runs in Ring 0, forcing the guest OS into Ring 1, which introduces performance overhead due to privilege emulation.
Hardware-assisted virtualization introduces a new privilege level called Ring -1, allowing the hypervisor to run below the OS kernel.
This separation allows the guest OS to operate at Ring 0, as it would on a physical machine, without compromising security or stability.
The hardware manages privilege transitions, removing the need for complex software emulation.

Advantages
Hardware-assisted virtualization offers several benefits:
Improved Performance: Reduces the overhead of privileged instruction emulation.
Simplified Hypervisor Design: Offloads tasks to the hardware, making the hypervisor more efficient.
Better Compatibility: Supports unmodified guest operating systems, unlike para-virtualization.

Conclusion
In summary, hardware-assisted virtualization revolutionizes full virtualization by introducing the Ring -1 concept and leveraging processor extensions like Intel VT-x and AMD-V. This approach ensures high performance and compatibility, making it the backbone of modern virtualization solutions.

Introduction
Now, let’s dive deeper into the first generation of hardware-assisted virtualization, which marked a major milestone in improving the performance and compatibility of virtualized environments.

Modern CPU Support
Starting in 2005, modern CPUs began including hardware extensions to support virtualization. These extensions were introduced by major CPU manufacturers:
Intel VT-x: Intel’s virtualization technology introduced in 2005.
AMD-V: AMD’s equivalent technology, also designed to assist virtualization at the hardware level.
These technologies allow virtualization tasks to be handled directly by the CPU, reducing overhead and increasing performance.

Key Innovations
No Modifications to Guest OS:

One of the groundbreaking features of hardware-assisted virtualization is that it allows unmodified guest operating systems to run in a virtualized environment.
Unlike para-virtualization, which required modifying the guest OS to work with the hypervisor, this approach ensures compatibility with all operating systems, provided they are supported by the hypervisor.
Elimination of Emulation:

In software-based virtualization, the hypervisor needed to emulate privileged instructions to ensure isolation and control. This process added significant performance overhead.
With hardware-assisted virtualization, emulation is no longer required because the CPU handles these instructions natively.
No Instruction Translation:

Similarly, there’s no need for instruction translation. Virtual machines can execute privileged instructions directly with the help of the CPU, making operations much faster and more efficient.

Significance of 2005
The introduction of Intel VT-x in 2005 marked the beginning of hardware-assisted virtualization, which quickly became an industry standard.
This innovation laid the foundation for the rapid adoption of virtualization across data centers, enabling the growth of cloud computing and modern infrastructure.

Conclusion
In summary, Generation 1 hardware-assisted virtualization transformed virtualization by introducing hardware extensions like Intel VT-x and AMD-V. These advancements eliminated the need for guest OS modifications, emulation, and instruction translation, ensuring high performance and broad compatibility with existing operating systems.

Introduction
Let’s move on to Generation 2 Hardware-Assisted Virtualization, which introduced significant advancements in memory management for virtualized environments. This generation is characterized by Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), a game-changing innovation for improving performance in virtualization.

Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
SLAT is a hardware feature that optimizes how virtualized environments manage memory. It eliminates one of the biggest bottlenecks in virtualization: translating memory addresses between the guest operating system and the physical hardware.
SLAT introduces an additional layer of translation tables that allow the hardware to handle memory mappings directly, rather than relying on the hypervisor.

Intel and AMD Implementations
Intel VT Extended Page Tables (EPT):

Intel’s implementation of SLAT is called Extended Page Tables (EPT). It simplifies the process of mapping guest virtual addresses to physical memory, reducing the overhead on the hypervisor.
With EPT, virtual machines experience improved performance, especially for workloads with high memory usage.
AMD-V Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI):

AMD’s equivalent to SLAT is Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI). It performs the same function as Intel’s EPT, enabling faster memory operations in virtualized environments.
RVI ensures that memory-intensive applications and workloads can run smoothly without excessive intervention from the hypervisor.

Advantages of SLAT
SLAT provides several key benefits for virtualized environments:
Reduced Hypervisor Overhead: By handling memory translations directly in hardware, SLAT reduces the workload on the hypervisor.
Improved Performance: Memory-intensive applications benefit significantly from faster address translation.
Enhanced Scalability: SLAT makes it easier to support a larger number of virtual machines on a single physical server, as memory management becomes more efficient.

Conclusion
In summary, Generation 2 Hardware-Assisted Virtualization introduced Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), implemented as Intel’s Extended Page Tables (EPT) and AMD’s Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI). This innovation dramatically improved performance and scalability for virtualized environments, making it a critical feature in modern virtualization solutions.

Virtualization simplifies disaster recovery by enabling easy backups, snapshots, and replication of virtual machines.
In the event of a hardware failure, virtual machines can be restored or migrated to other servers quickly, minimizing downtime and data loss.

Isolation and Security
Virtual machines are isolated from each other, meaning that issues in one VM, such as crashes or security breaches, do not affect others running on the same physical server.
This isolation enhances security by reducing the attack surface and containing vulnerabilities to specific virtual environments.

Simplified Management
Virtualization platforms come with advanced tools for centralized management of virtualized resources.
Features like live migration, dynamic resource allocation, and automated scaling make it easier for administrators to manage workloads efficiently.
For example, tools like VMware vCenter, Hyper-V Manager, and OpenStack streamline the process of deploying, monitoring, and managing virtual environments.

Conclusion
In summary, virtualization delivers a wide range of benefits, including resource efficiency, cost savings, enhanced disaster recovery, isolation for security, and simplified management. These advantages make it a cornerstone technology for modern data centers and cloud infrastructure.

Containers are a type of operating system virtualization that isolates applications within their own user space instances. This means that multiple containers can share the same OS kernel while remaining isolated from one another.

How Containers Work
OS Kernel Creates Isolated User Spaces:

The operating system kernel uses mechanisms like namespaces and cgroups to create isolated user spaces for each container.
Namespace isolation ensures that a process within one container only sees its own resources, such as filesystems and network interfaces.
Cgroups limit and allocate resources like CPU and memory to prevent resource contention between containers.
Isolation:

Processes inside one container are completely isolated from processes in other containers. This means:
A process from one user space can only access its own environment.
It cannot affect or interfere with processes running in another user space.

Advantages
Containers are much more lightweight and portable than virtual machines because they do not require a separate OS for each instance.
They are designed to start and stop quickly, making them ideal for modern architectures like microservices.

Security Considerations
Despite their advantages, containers have inherent security risks:
Container escape vulnerabilities: These occur when a process inside a container breaks out of its isolation and gains unauthorized access to the host system or other containers.
Because containers share the same OS kernel, they are generally considered less secure than virtual machines for certain use cases.
For workloads requiring high security or strict isolation, virtual machines might still be the preferred approach.

Conclusion
In summary, containers provide lightweight and portable application environments, making them the standard for modern architectures. However, their security limitations, including potential escape vulnerabilities, must be carefully considered, especially for sensitive or critical workloads.

Introduction
To understand how containers achieve isolation and resource management, we need to explore two foundational concepts: namespace isolation and cgroups (control groups). These are core features of the Linux kernel that enable container functionality.

Namespace Isolation
Namespaces provide the isolation that allows each container to operate as if it were the only process running on the system.
By separating different aspects of the system, namespaces ensure containers have their own isolated environment. Let’s break this down:
Process Tree:

Each container has its own process tree, meaning it only sees processes running within its own namespace.
This isolation prevents one container from interacting with or even seeing processes in another container.
Networking:

Containers have their own network namespace, which isolates network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables.
This ensures each container can have its own network configuration independent of others.
User IDs:

User namespace isolation maps container user IDs to different host system IDs, providing an additional layer of security.
File Systems (Mounts):

Each container has its own file system namespace, allowing it to see and interact with its own mount points without interfering with others.
Inter-Process Communication (IPC):

IPC namespaces isolate communication mechanisms like shared memory and message queues, ensuring processes in one container cannot interfere with those in another.

Resource Limitation (cgroups)
Control Groups (cgroups) manage and limit the resources that containers can use, ensuring fair allocation and preventing resource hogging.
Let’s look at the key resources that cgroups control:
CPU:

Cgroups allow you to limit how much CPU time a container can consume, ensuring no single container overwhelms the host.
Memory:

You can set strict memory limits for containers to prevent a single container from consuming all the host’s memory and causing issues for other workloads.
I/O:

Cgroups control disk I/O, ensuring containers cannot monopolize storage performance, which is critical for shared environments.
Network:

Network bandwidth limits can be applied to ensure fair usage among containers and prevent congestion.

Conclusion
In summary, namespace isolation provides containers with their own independent environments, separating processes, networking, users, file systems, and IPC mechanisms. Cgroups complement this by managing and limiting resource usage, ensuring fair allocation and preventing resource contention. Together, these features enable containers to operate efficiently, securely, and predictably in shared environments.

Isolation
Containers provide isolation, which is critical for multi-tenant environments:
Each container runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that its processes, file system, and network are separate from other containers.
This means that issues in one container don’t affect others, improving reliability and security for applications running on the same host.

Scalability
Containers are designed for scalability, particularly in modern cloud-native architectures:
They are easy to scale horizontally, meaning you can quickly add more container instances to handle increased workload demands.
This makes containers ideal for applications that need to scale dynamically, such as microservices or workloads running in Kubernetes.

Conclusion
In summary, containers offer unmatched portability, efficiency, isolation, and scalability, making them a preferred choice for modern application development and deployment. These advantages enable organizations to build, deploy, and scale applications faster and more reliably.

Introduction
Let’s explore the core components of Docker that work together to enable containerization. Each component plays a vital role in building, shipping, and running containers effectively.

Docker CLI
Docker CLI is the command-line tool that allows users to interact with Docker.
With the CLI, you can perform various operations such as building images, running containers, managing networks, and more.
It’s the primary interface for controlling Docker, making it accessible for both developers and system administrators.

Docker Engine
Docker Engine is the core service that powers Docker. It creates, ships, and runs containers on your system, whether it’s a physical server, virtual machine, or cloud environment.
The engine consists of two parts:
A daemon process that manages Docker objects like images and containers.
A REST API for communication between the Docker CLI and the daemon.

Docker Image
Docker Images are the blueprint for creating containers.
An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a specific application—such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
Images are built using a Dockerfile, and they serve as the foundation for every container you run.

Registry Service
The registry service is where Docker images are stored and distributed. Think of it as a repository for your images.
Common examples include Docker Hub (a public registry) and private registries hosted by organizations.
Registries make it easy to share images across teams or deploy them to production environments.

Docker Container
Docker Containers are the standard unit in which applications execute.
They are running instances of Docker images, isolated from each other and the host system.
Containers provide a consistent runtime environment, making it easy to deploy and scale applications.

Conclusion
In summary, Docker consists of several key components: the CLI for user interaction, the Engine for running containers, Images as the foundation, the Registry for image storage and distribution, and Containers as the execution environment.

Docker Image
A read-only template
Contains the application code, libraries, dependencies
Contains also configuration needed to run a container
Built using a series of layers
Can be easily reused across different environments
Introduction
Let’s explore Docker Images, the building blocks of containers. A Docker Image is essentially a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.

What is a Docker Image?
Docker Image is a read-only template that serves as the foundation for creating and running containers.
It packages everything an application needs to run, ensuring consistency and portability across environments.

Key Features
Contains the Application Code, Libraries, and Dependencies:

A Docker Image includes all the files, libraries, and runtime dependencies that the application requires to function properly.
This eliminates the need to manually configure dependencies during deployment.
Includes Configuration Needed to Run a Container:

Images also contain configurations such as environment variables, working directories, and commands to initialize the container.
Built Using a Series of Layers:

Docker Images are created in layers, where each layer represents a specific change or instruction in the Dockerfile.
For example, one layer might add the application code, while another installs a dependency.
This layered structure makes Docker Images lightweight and efficient, as unchanged layers can be reused across different images.
Reusable Across Environments:

Docker Images are designed to be portable, meaning they can be used in development, testing, and production environments without modification.
This ensures that the application behaves the same way, no matter where it is deployed.

Docker and Union Filesystem
Layers multiple filesystems to create a single unified view
Stacks multiple layers to form a complete filesystem
Read-Only and Read-Write Layers
Read-Only Layers: Base image layers shared among containers
Read-Write Layer: Added on top, storing changes specific to that container


Introduction
Let’s dive into the concept of Union Filesystem, a key technology behind Docker’s efficiency and flexibility. This approach allows Docker to create lightweight and reusable container images by layering filesystems.

What is a Union Filesystem?
A Union Filesystem combines multiple filesystems into a single, unified view.
It enables Docker to efficiently stack multiple layers to form a complete filesystem for each container.

How It Works
Layers Multiple Filesystems:

Docker Images are built in layers, with each layer representing a set of changes or instructions in the Dockerfile.
The Union Filesystem merges these layers to present them as a single, unified filesystem.
Stacks Multiple Layers:

When you create a container, Docker adds a read-write layer on top of the image’s read-only layers. This stacked approach forms the complete filesystem that the container uses.

Read-Only and Read-Write Layers
Read-Only Layers:

These are the base image layers shared among containers, such as operating system files and pre-installed libraries.
Since they are read-only, they can be reused across multiple containers, saving disk space and improving efficiency.
Read-Write Layer:

Each container has its own read-write layer, where any changes specific to that container are stored.
This layer holds modifications like added files, application logs, or temporary data generated during runtime.

Conclusion
In summary, Docker’s use of the Union Filesystem enables efficient and flexible containerization by stacking read-only layers and a read-write layer. This approach ensures lightweight images, resource efficiency, and fast deployment of containers.

Building Docker Images: Interactive vs. Dockerfile
Interactive Mode

Build images interactively by manually entering commands
Start a base container interactively
Execute commands (e.g., install software, modify files)
Commit changes to a new image
Good only for quick testing or prototyping
Dockerfile

Build image using a declarative text file containing instructions
Define the Dockerfile with all instructions
Build the new image
Automation-friendly, supporting CI/CD pipelines
Introduction
Let’s look at the two primary methods for building Docker images: Interactive Mode and using a Dockerfile. Each approach has its use cases and advantages, depending on your needs.

Interactive Mode
What is Interactive Mode?

In Interactive Mode, you manually build a Docker image by entering commands in a running container.
This approach involves starting with a base container, making modifications interactively, and then saving the changes as a new image.
Steps:

Start a base container interactively using the docker run command.
Execute commands inside the container, such as installing software or modifying files.
Once you’re done, use the docker commit command to save the container as a new image.
When to Use?

Interactive mode is useful for quick testing or prototyping, where you want to experiment with changes without setting up a formal build process.
However, it’s not ideal for production workflows as it lacks automation and reproducibility.

Dockerfile
What is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a declarative text file that contains a list of instructions for building a Docker image.
It automates the process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
Steps:

Create a Dockerfile that defines all the steps for building your image, such as setting the base image, installing dependencies, copying files, and configuring the environment.
Use the docker build command to generate a new image from the Dockerfile.
Advantages:

The Dockerfile approach is automation-friendly and works seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, making it ideal for production environments.
It ensures that images can be reproduced consistently, regardless of the environment in which they are built.

Comparison
While Interactive Mode is good for quick experiments, the Dockerfile method is the standard for production-ready images, offering automation, consistency, and scalability.

Conclusion
In summary, both Interactive Mode and Dockerfiles allow you to build Docker images. However, for professional workflows and automation, Dockerfiles are the preferred choice due to their consistency and integration with modern DevOps practices.

Reference: https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/
Introduction
Let’s break down some of the key Dockerfile instructions. Each instruction defines a specific action or configuration for building a Docker image, enabling you to customize the container environment effectively.

Key Dockerfile Instructions
FROM:

The FROM instruction specifies the base image that the Docker image will build upon.
Every Dockerfile must begin with a FROM statement.
Example: FROM ubuntu:20.04 sets Ubuntu 20.04 as the base image.
RUN:

The RUN instruction executes commands during the image build process.
It’s typically used for installing dependencies or setting up the environment.
Example: RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 installs Python3 in the container.
COPY:

The COPY instruction copies files or directories from the host system to the container.
Example: COPY app.py /app/ copies the app.py file into the /app/ directory inside the container.
ADD:

The ADD instruction is similar to COPY but with extra functionality.
It can extract compressed files (e.g., .tar.gz) and download files from a URL.
Example: ADD archive.tar.gz /data/ extracts the archive into the /data/ directory.
CMD or ENTRYPOINT:

These instructions define the default command or script that runs when the container starts.
CMD provides a default command that can be overridden, while ENTRYPOINT sets a fixed command.
Example: CMD [python3, app.py] runs the app.py script with Python.
WORKDIR:

The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory inside the container.
All subsequent instructions will use this directory as the current directory.
Example: WORKDIR /app sets /app as the working directory.
ENV:

The ENV instruction sets environment variables in the container.
Example: ENV PORT=8080 defines a PORT environment variable with the value 8080.
EXPOSE:

The EXPOSE instruction describes which network ports the container listens on.
It’s a documentation hint and doesn’t actually open ports on the host.
Example: EXPOSE 3000 indicates that the container listens on port 3000.

Reference
For a full list of Dockerfile instructions, refer to the official documentation: https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/.

Conclusion
In summary, Dockerfile instructions provide a declarative way to customize the container environment. By understanding and using these commands effectively, you can create robust, portable, and consistent Docker images for your applications.

To view all the images stored locally on your system, use the docker images command.
This provides a list of available images, showing their repository name, tag, image ID, size, and creation date.
Remove an Image

The docker rmi command removes an image from your local machine.
Example: docker rmi image-name deletes the specified image.
This helps free up disk space by removing unused or outdated images.
Build an Image

To create a new image, use the docker build command.
Example: docker build . -t image-name builds an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as image-name.
This command is essential for packaging your application into a reusable image.
View Image Details

The docker inspect command provides detailed information about an image or container.
Example: docker inspect image-name shows metadata such as layers, environment variables, and configuration.
This is useful for debugging and understanding how an image is structured.
Push an Image

To share your image with others or deploy it to production, use the docker push command to upload it to a registry.
Example: docker push my-username/my-image uploads the image to the registry under your namespace.
This is commonly used in CI/CD pipelines to make images available for deployment.

Conclusion
In summary, Docker provides a rich set of commands for managing images, from pulling and building to inspecting and pushing them. These commands form the foundation of working with Docker, enabling you to efficiently manage your application’s lifecycle.

Remove a container: docker rm container-name
Introduction
Let’s discuss Docker Containers, which are the core runtime instances in Docker. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that run applications, making them an essential part of modern software deployment.

What is a Docker Container?
Docker Container is a running instance of a Docker image.
It takes everything defined in the Docker image and starts it as a self-contained application environment.
Containers are designed to be isolated and lightweight, sharing the host OS kernel while keeping processes, filesystems, and networks separate.
They are typically stateless, meaning they don’t store data persistently. If needed, data is managed externally through volumes or databases.

Key Commands
Run a Container

To start a container, use the docker run command.
Example: docker run image-name creates and starts a container based on the specified image.
You can also add options like -d for detached mode or -p for port mapping.
Running a container is the most basic operation in Docker and the starting point for using your images.
List Running Containers

The docker ps command shows all currently running containers.
It provides important details like container ID, image name, status, ports, and names.
Use the -a option (docker ps -a) to see all containers, including stopped ones.
Remove a Container

To delete a container, use the docker rm command.
Example: docker rm container-name removes the specified container by its name or ID.
If the container is still running, you’ll need to stop it first using docker stop container-name.

Conclusion
In summary, a Docker Container is a lightweight and isolated environment created from an image. Commands like docker run, docker ps, and docker rm allow you to effectively manage containers, enabling a flexible and efficient application lifecycle.

Introduction
Let’s explore how to manage Docker Containers, focusing on key commands for running, interacting with, stopping, starting, and removing containers. These operations form the foundation of working with Docker.

Key Commands for Working with Containers
Run a Container
To start a container in detached mode (in the background), use the docker run command with the -d flag.
Example: docker run -d --name myapp image:
-d: Runs the container in detached mode.
--name myapp: Assigns a specific name (myapp) to the container.
image: Specifies the image to use for the container.
This is a common way to run containers for applications like web servers.

Run in Interactive Mode
To start a container in interactive mode, use the -it option with the docker run command.
Example: docker run -it --name myapp image /bin/bash:
-it: Combines the options to run in interactive mode with a TTY (terminal).
/bin/bash: Opens a shell inside the container.
Interactive mode is useful for debugging or troubleshooting configuration within the container.

Stop a Running Container
Use the docker stop command to stop a running container gracefully.
Example: docker stop myapp stops the container named myapp.
Stopping a container frees up system resources while preserving its state for later use.

Start a Stopped Container
To restart a previously stopped container, use the docker start command.
Example: docker start myapp starts the container named myapp.
This is useful for resuming a container without recreating it.

Remove a Container
To delete a container, use the docker rm command.
Example: docker rm myapp removes the container named myapp from the system.

Environment Variables and Ports Mapping
Provide environment variables
docker run -e VAR_NAME=var_value -d --name myapp myimage

Map ports
docker run -p 8000:8000 -it --name myapp myimage

Introduction
Let’s discuss two important concepts when working with Docker containers: environment variables and ports mapping. These features allow you to configure containers dynamically and expose services to the host system.

Environment Variables
What Are Environment Variables in Docker?
Environment variables provide a way to pass configuration values into containers at runtime.
This is useful for setting parameters like database URLs, API keys, or application-specific settings without modifying the container image.

Command Example
To pass an environment variable to a container, use the -e flag with the docker run command.
Example: docker run -e VAR_NAME=var_value -d --name myapp image:
-e VAR_NAME=var_value: Sets the environment variable VAR_NAME to var_value inside the container.
-d: Runs the container in detached mode.
--name myapp: Assigns the name myapp to the container.
myimage: Specifies the Docker image to use.

Use Case
Environment variables allow for flexible and reusable container configurations, enabling the same image to run in multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with different settings.

Ports Mapping
What is Ports Mapping?
Ports mapping connects a container’s internal ports to the host machine, making services running inside the container accessible externally.
This is essential for applications like web servers, where you need to expose the container’s ports to users or other systems.

Command Example
To map a port, use the -p flag with the docker run command.
Example: docker run -p 8000:8000 -it --name myapp image /bin/bash:
-p 8000:8000: Maps port 8000 on the host to port 8000 in the container.
-it: Runs the container in interactive mode with a TTY.
--name myapp: Assigns the name myapp to the container.
myimage: Specifies the Docker image to use.

Use Case
Ports mapping allows developers to access containerized services, such as APIs or web applications, through the host machine’s network interface.

Conclusion
In summary, environment variables and ports mapping are crucial for configuring containers and making them accessible. Mastering these features ensures flexible, scalable, and production-ready container deployments.

Docker Volumes
Persistent storage solution for Docker containers
Data persists even if the container is deleted
Managed outside the container’s filesystem
Making backups and migrations easier
Introduction
Let’s talk about Docker Volumes, a solution for managing persistent data in Docker containers. Volumes are essential for scenarios where container data needs to be preserved beyond the container’s lifecycle.

What are Docker Volumes?
Docker Volumes provide a persistent storage solution for containers.
Unlike data stored inside the container’s filesystem, which is lost when the container is removed, volumes ensure that data persists even after the container is deleted.

Key Features of Docker Volumes
Persistent Data Storage:
Volumes allow containers to store data persistently, making them suitable for use cases like databases or user-generated content.
Data stored in a volume is not tied to the container lifecycle.

Managed Outside the Container’s Filesystem:
Volumes exist independently of containers and are managed by Docker.
This separation makes volumes a more flexible and reliable way to handle data compared to container-bound storage.

Data Backups and Migrations:
Since volumes are external to containers, they can be easily backed up and restored.
They also simplify migrating data between containers or across different Docker hosts.

Why Use Docker Volumes?
Docker Volumes are particularly useful for applications requiring data persistence, such as:
Databases that need consistent storage.
Web applications storing uploaded files.
Logging systems where historical logs must be retained.

Conclusion
In summary, Docker Volumes provide a robust way to handle persistent data, ensuring data durability and simplifying backups and migrations. They are an indispensable part of modern containerized applications where data persistence is required.

Types of Docker Volumes
Volume
Stored in host directory (default /var/lib/docker/volumes/)
Bind Mount
Links to a specific directory or file on the host system
tmpfs Mount
Stores data in memory, creating a temporary filesystem
Introduction
Let’s dive into the types of Docker volumes. Docker provides several volume types to handle data storage, each with its unique use cases, allowing you to choose the best solution based on your application’s needs.

Types of Docker Volumes
Volume:
A Volume is the most commonly used type of Docker volume.
It’s stored in a Docker-managed directory on the host system, with the default location being /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
Volumes are fully managed by Docker, ensuring they are portable and independent of the host filesystem structure.
Use Case:
Ideal for applications that need persistent, easily manageable data storage, such as databases.

Bind Mount:
A Bind Mount links a specific directory or file on the host system to a directory or file inside the container.
Unlike volumes, bind mounts are tied to the host’s filesystem and require the exact path to be specified.
Use Case:
Bind mounts are particularly useful for mapping configuration files from the host to the container, enabling easy customization without modifying the container image.

tmpfs Mount:
A tmpfs Mount stores data in the host system’s memory rather than on disk, creating a temporary filesystem.
This ensures fast read/write speeds and automatic cleanup when the container stops.
Use Case:
Ideal for sensitive data or temporary files that don’t need to persist beyond the container’s lifecycle, such as cache or session data.

Comparison and Best Practices
While Volumes are the go-to choice for persistent storage, Bind Mounts offer flexibility for mapping config files to the containers, and tmpfs Mounts provide high-speed, ephemeral storage for temporary needs.
Choose the type that aligns with your application’s requirements.

Conclusion
In summary, Docker offers Volumes, Bind Mounts, and tmpfs Mounts to cater to a variety of storage scenarios. Understanding these types helps you design efficient and robust containerized applications.

Introduction
Let’s look at how to create and use Docker volumes. Volumes are an essential feature for managing persistent data in containerized applications, and Docker provides simple commands to handle their lifecycle.

Key Commands for Working with Volumes
Creating a Volume

The docker volume create command creates a new volume managed by Docker.
Example: docker volume create my-volume:
Creates a volume named my-volume that can be used by containers for persistent storage.
This is the first step in setting up a volume for data storage.
Attaching a Volume to a Container

The -v option in the docker run command attaches a volume to a specific directory inside the container.
Example: docker run -v my-volume:/data my-container:
my-volume: Specifies the name of the volume.
/data: Mounts the volume to the /data directory inside the container.
This allows the container to read from and write to the volume, ensuring data persists even if the container is removed.
Inspecting a Volume

The docker volume inspect command provides detailed information about a volume.
Example: docker volume inspect my-volume:
Displays metadata such as mount points, creation date, and usage details.
This command is useful for verifying volume configuration and troubleshooting issues.
Deleting a Volume

The docker volume rm command removes a volume from the system.
Example: docker volume rm my-volume:

Introduction
Let’s explore how to use Bind Mounts, a feature that allows you to mount directories or files from the host system into a container. Bind mounts are particularly useful for sharing data, such as configuration files, or enabling real-time updates during development.

Key Bind Mount Commands
Mount a Directory

To mount a directory from the host system into a container, use the -v option with the docker run command.
Example: docker run -v /host/dir:/container/dir my-container:
/host/dir: Specifies the directory on the host system.
/container/dir: Specifies the directory inside the container where the host directory will be mounted.
my-container: The name of the container image to run.
This command allows the container to access and modify files in the host directory in real time.
Use Case:

Useful for sharing code or data between the host and container during development or testing.
Mount a File

To mount a specific file from the host system into a container, the syntax is similar to mounting a directory.
Example: docker run -v /host/file:/container/file my-container:
/host/file: Specifies the file on the host system.
/container/file: Specifies the path inside the container where the host file will appear.
This is ideal for injecting configuration files or sensitive credentials into a container.
Use Case:

Allows containers to use specific host-based files, such as .env files, without bundling them into the image.

Important Notes
Bind mounts are directly tied to the host filesystem, so changes made in the host directory or file will reflect inside the container and vice versa.

Bridge Network
Default network
In the default bridge network containers can communicate only via internal IP
In custome brdige networks containers can communicate also via name
Uses NAT (Network Address Translation)
Useful for local development
Introduction
Let’s talk about the Bridge Network, which is the default network type in Docker. It’s designed to enable container communication within the same host, providing isolation and flexibility for local development.

Key Features of the Bridge Network
Default Network:
By default, when you start a container without specifying a network, Docker connects it to the bridge network.

Communication in the Default Bridge Network:
In the default bridge network, containers can communicate only via their internal IP addresses.
This means you need to know the container’s IP address for them to interact, which may not be ideal for containers that depends on other containers.

Custom Bridge Networks:
When you create a custom bridge network, Docker adds name-based resolution.
Containers can communicate using their names, making service discovery much easier.
For example, a container named web can interact with a database container named db simply by using the name db.

Network Address Translation (NAT):
The bridge network uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to connect containers to external networks, such as the internet.
This ensures that containers can access external resources while maintaining isolation.

Use Case:
The bridge network is particularly useful for local development, where you need isolated environments for testing without exposing them externally.

Conclusion
In summary, the Bridge Network provides a default and customizable solution for container communication on the same host. Its support for NAT, IP-based communication, and name resolution in custom setups makes it versatile for various development scenarios.

Host Network
Shares the host’s network namespace
Allow containers to use the host’s IP address and ports
Less isolation
Increasing potential security risks
Suitable for applications where performance is critical
Example: Monitoring and logging tools
Introduction
Let’s discuss the Host Network, a networking mode in Docker that allows containers to share the host’s network stack. This approach is useful for scenarios where performance is critical, but it comes with trade-offs in isolation and security.

Key Features of Host Network
Shares the Host’s Network Namespace:
In the Host Network mode, the container does not have its own isolated network stack.
Instead, it shares the host system’s network namespace, using the host’s IP address and network interfaces.

Allows Containers to Use Host’s IP Address and Ports:
Containers in this mode use the same IP address as the host system and directly bind to its ports.
This eliminates the need for port mappings, as the container operates as if it were running directly on the host.

Less Isolation:
Because the container shares the host’s network stack, there is reduced isolation compared to other network modes.
This may increase the risk of conflicts and potential interference between containers or with the host.

Increased Security Risks:
Sharing the host’s network stack increases the attack surface, as vulnerabilities in the container can potentially impact the host system.
This makes it less suitable for untrusted applications.

Use Case:
The Host Network is suitable for applications where performance is critical and network overhead must be minimized.
Examples include monitoring tools, logging systems, or applications requiring extremely low-latency network communication.

Conclusion
In summary, the Host Network mode offers performance benefits by eliminating network isolation but comes with reduced security and isolation. Use it carefully for performance-critical scenarios while considering the trade-offs.

The Overlay Network allows containers running on different hosts to communicate seamlessly as if they were on the same network.
This is especially important for deploying distributed applications.

Commonly Used with Docker Swarm:
The Overlay Network is a default choice when working with orchestration tools like Docker Swarm.
It provides service discovery and load balancing, which are essential for managing containerized services across multiple nodes.

Virtual Network that Spans Multiple Hosts:
The Overlay Network creates a virtual network that operates across multiple Docker hosts, enabling container-to-container communication regardless of the physical host.
This is achieved by encapsulating network traffic between hosts, making it appear as if all containers are on a single network.

Use Case:
The Overlay Network is designed for distributed applications that run across multiple hosts, such as microservices architectures or clustered databases.
It simplifies the deployment and scaling of these applications by abstracting network complexities.

Conclusion
In summary, the Overlay Network is a crucial tool for enabling multi-host communication in Docker, particularly in distributed systems. It’s a foundational element for orchestrated environments like Docker Swarm, ensuring seamless container-to-container communication across hosts.

Macvlan Network
Assigns a unique MAC address to each container
Allows containers to appear as separate devices on the network
Provides direct network access
Suitable for complex network setups needing unique network identities
Introduction
Let’s discuss the Macvlan Network, a specialized Docker network mode that assigns each container its own unique MAC address. This approach is particularly useful for advanced network setups requiring unique network identities for containers.

Key Features of Macvlan Network
Assigns a Unique MAC Address to Each Container:
In a Macvlan Network, each container gets its own MAC address, making it appear as a separate device on the network.
This is different from most other Docker network modes, where containers share the host’s network interface.

Allows Containers to Appear as Separate Devices:
Since each container has its own MAC address, it can be treated as an independent network entity.
This enables containers to communicate directly with other devices on the network, bypassing the Docker bridge.

Provides Direct Network Access:
Containers in a Macvlan Network can send and receive network traffic directly, just like physical devices.
This results in minimal overhead and better performance for certain use cases.

Suitable for Complex Network Setups Needing Unique Network Identities:
The Macvlan Network is ideal for scenarios requiring containers to integrate tightly with existing network infrastructures.
Use Cases:
Environments where containers need to appear as distinct devices, such as legacy applications requiring static IPs or MAC addresses.
Situations where direct communication with physical network devices is necessary.

Conclusion
In summary, the Macvlan Network is a powerful option for advanced use cases requiring unique network identities for containers. It provides direct network access and better integration with complex network setups, making it a valuable tool for specialized deployment scenarios.

Important Note:
A network cannot be removed if it has active containers connected to it.

Run a Container in a Network
To start a container within a specific network, use the --network option with the docker run command.
Example: docker run --network network-name --name my-container -d nginx:
--network network-name: Connects the container to the specified network.
--name my-container: Assigns the name my-container to the container.
-d nginx: Runs an Nginx container in detached mode.
This ensures that the container is part of the designated network for communication with other containers.

Conclusion
In summary, managing Docker networks involves key operations such as listing, creating, inspecting, and removing networks. Running containers within specific networks allows for better organization, service discovery, and communication.

Images Best Practices
Use official or verified base images whenever possible
Minimize the number of layers in your image
Order commands for maximum layer caching
Avoid unnecessary tools and dependencies
Leverage .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
Use multistage builds to optimize image size.
Pin specific versions of dependencies to ensure consistency
Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities
Remove sensitive data like credentials from images
Introduction
When working with Docker images, following best practices ensures that your images are efficient, secure, and maintainable. Let’s go over some key recommendations for building and managing Docker images.

Images Best Practices
Use Official or Verified Base Images
Always start with official or verified images whenever possible.
These images are maintained by trusted sources and often include security updates, reducing vulnerabilities.
For example, use python:3.9-slim rather than unknown or untrusted sources.

Minimize the Number of Layers
Each RUN, COPY, or ADD command creates a new layer in your image.
Reducing layers improves performance and reduces image size.

Order Commands for Maximum Layer Caching
Order your commands to take advantage of Docker’s caching mechanism.
For example, place commands that rarely change (e.g., installing dependencies) before commands that change frequently (e.g., copying application code).

Avoid Unnecessary Tools and Dependencies
Do not include tools or libraries that are not required for your application.
This keeps your image lightweight and reduces the attack surface.

Leverage .dockerignore to Exclude Unnecessary Files
Use a .dockerignore file to prevent unnecessary files (e.g., logs, temp files, and build artifacts) from being added to your image.
This reduces build context size and improves performance.

Use Multistage Builds to Optimize Image Size
Multistage builds allow you to separate build and runtime environments.
For example, compile your application in one stage and copy only the necessary files into the final image.

Pin Specific Versions of Dependencies
Pinning versions ensures consistency across builds.
For example, specify RUN apt-get install nginx=1.18.0 instead of simply nginx to avoid unintentional updates.

Regularly Scan Images for Vulnerabilities
Use tools like docker scan, Trivy, or Clair to check for vulnerabilities in your images.
This helps identify and mitigate security risks before deployment.

Remove Sensitive Data from Images
Do not hardcode credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information into your image.
Use environment variables or secret management tools instead.

Conclusion
By following these best practices, you can create Docker images that are secure, efficient, and reliable. This not only improves performance but also enhances the overall security and maintainability of your containerized applications.

Docker Best Practices
Container should run a single application
Keep containers stateless and immutable
Use environment variables for sensitve data
Mount config files to avoid hardcoded configurations
Set resource limits (memory and CPU) for containers
Log to stdout and stderr for centralized logging
Always tag images with meaningful and versioned tags
Use a private container registry for custom images
Introduction
To ensure efficient, secure, and maintainable Docker environments, it’s important to follow best practices when working with containers. Let’s go over the key recommendations for container management and deployment.

Docker Best Practices
Run a Single Application per Container
Each container should be dedicated to a single application or process.
This follows the principle of microservices, improving modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
For example, run your web server and database in separate containers instead of combining them.

Keep Containers Stateless and Immutable
Containers should not store persistent data; use volumes or external storage for that purpose.
Immutable containers ensure consistency across deployments, as the container doesn’t change after being built.

Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data
Store sensitive information like credentials and API keys in environment variables.
Avoid hardcoding these values into your image or application code for better security and flexibility.

Mount Configuration Files
Use bind mounts to inject configuration files into containers.
This avoids hardcoding configurations into the image and allows easy updates.

Set Resource Limits (Memory and CPU)
Define resource constraints for containers to prevent them from consuming excessive host resources.
Example: Use --memory and --cpus options in the docker run command to set limits.

Log to stdout and stderr
Configure applications to log to stdout and stderr to take advantage of Docker’s centralized logging capabilities.
This simplifies integration with logging tools like ELK Stack or Fluentd.

Tag Images with Meaningful and Versioned Tags
Always use descriptive and versioned tags for your images.
For example, tag images as myapp:1.0 or myapp:stable instead of using latest for every version.

Use a Private Container Registry
Store custom images in a private registry to enhance security and control access.
This is especially important for proprietary software or sensitive applications.

Conclusion
By following these best practices, you can create secure, efficient, and scalable Docker environments. These guidelines ensure containers are easy to manage and ready for production deployment.

Docker Compose ensures seamless interaction between services by automating container orchestration.
Example:
A web container for a frontend application.
A db container for the backend database.
A cache container for a caching layer like Redis.

Key Commands
Start Compose
The docker-compose up -d command starts all the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
Example: docker-compose up -d:
up: Launches the application and its services.
-d: Runs the containers in detached mode, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

Destroy Compose
The docker-compose down command stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes defined in the Compose file.
Example: docker-compose down:
Cleans up the environment, ensuring no lingering resources consume system resources.

Use Cases
Docker Compose is ideal for:
Local development environments.
Testing and staging setups that require multiple containers.
Simplifying multi-container application deployment processes.

Conclusion
In summary, Docker Compose provides an efficient way to define and manage multi-container applications using a single YAML configuration file. With simple commands like docker-compose up and docker-compose down, you can quickly deploy, manage, and clean up complex environments.

Docker Swarm
Apache Mesos
Introduction:

Let’s explore some of the most popular container orchestrators available today. Each of these tools has unique features and strengths, making them suitable for different environments and requirements.

Kubernetes:

First, we have Kubernetes, which is by far the most widely used and feature-rich container orchestrator. Kubernetes was originally developed by Google and is now an open-source project managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
Kubernetes provides advanced features like automated scaling, self-healing, and load balancing and has an extensive ecosystem of plugins and tools. It’s known for its flexibility and can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, making it ideal for complex, large-scale applications.

HashiCorp Nomad:

Next is HashiCorp Nomad, a flexible orchestrator designed to support a wide range of workloads, not just containers. Nomad can run containers, but it also supports virtual machines, applications, and other types of jobs, making it a good fit for heterogeneous environments.
One of Nomad’s main strengths is its lightweight, simple architecture, which makes it easy to deploy and scale. Nomad is often chosen for hybrid or multi-cloud environments and can be integrated with other HashiCorp tools like Consul and Vault for added functionality.

Docker Swarm:

Docker Swarm is Docker’s native orchestration tool, designed for ease of use and quick setup. Docker Swarm is fully integrated with Docker, so it’s great for teams already using Docker who want to start orchestrating containers without learning a new tool.
Docker Swarm is often chosen for smaller setups or simple workloads where ease of deployment and Docker integration are more important than advanced features. Swarm provides basic orchestration functionality like scaling and load balancing but lacks some of the more advanced features of Kubernetes.
